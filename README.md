A simple web calculator implemented in JavaScript. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes features like decimal input, backspace functionality, and error handling. Error handling refers to division by zero or pressing the equal sign before all the data is entered. In both cases, an alert is displayed for the user.
